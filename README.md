# Fatigue Analysis in Ice Hockey Players

## Objective
Estimation and Analysis of "Fatigue Levels in Ice Hockey Players" using game data to help improve game strategies. 

## Usage
Upload game data files and immediately get feedback on fatigue levels of players.

## Core Features
- **Instant Fatigue Indexing:** Quick and accurate analysis of players fatigue.
- **File Uploading:** Simple data integration to make informed decisions.
- **Interactive Visualizations:** Check players fatigue levels during different intervals of the game with interactive visualizations.

## Applications
1. **Player Management and Rotation:** The Fatigue Index (FI) assists coaches in making real-time decisions about player rotations, ensuring optimum performance while reducing injury risks.
2. **Injury Prevention in Training:** Utilize FI to customize training intensity and recovery sessions, further minimizing the risk of injuries.
3. **Performance Analysis and Strategy:** Incorporate FI with other performance metrics to refine and adapt game strategies, ensuring data-driven decisions during matches.

## Dataset Challenges
- **Anonymity:** Player data is anonymized, which led us to make certain assumptions to proceed.
- **Volume:** The small sample size combined with the sheer number of metrics means careful selection and analysis is key.
- **Player Role Identification:** Assumptions were made based on known team structures to decipher player roles from the provided data.

## Methodology
1. **Data Selection:** Initial data considerations based on assumed team structures.
2. **Role Analysis:** Use of the 'Position' metric to identify players' roles.
3. **Data Filtering:** Metrics were filtered based on relevance for fatigue analysis.
4. **Fatigue Formula Development:** A tailored formula was crafted considering the dataset's unique characteristics.
5. **Fatigue Level Assessment:** Predictive fatigue analysis using the crafted formula.
6. **Visualization:** Crafting an intuitive visualization to depict player fatigue levels.
